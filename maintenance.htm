<p><b>NOTES ON MAINTENANCE TREATMENT OF VTE</b></p>

<p>Following initial heparinisation or fondaparinux in patients with VTE, maintenance of anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants is recommended. Following discharge, those on warfarin should be followed up within a week with a repeat INR. </p>

<p>If the INR remains within therapeutic range, the same dose is maintained and the next follow-up will be 2 weeks later. If the INR still remains within therapeutic range, then monthly follow-up with INR is advised. More frequent visits are required if therapeutic INR is not achieved.</p>

<p>Patients on rivaroxaban do not need initial heparinisation or laboratory monitoring. Patients are seen within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment to monitor response and to assess drug tolerability. Thereafter monthly follow-up is advised.</p>

<p><b>Duration of anticoagulation</b></p>

<p>The aim of anticoagulant therapy is to prevent extension of the thrombus and recurrence of the disease; however, the optimal duration is still not known. Anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the reduction of recurrent VTE no longer outweighs the increase risk of bleeding.</p>

<p><b> Risk factors for VTE recurrence</b></p>

<p>The risk of recurrence after stopping therapy is primarily determined by two factors: </p>

<p>(1) whether the acute episode of VTE has been effectively treated and </p>

<p>(2) the patient's intrinsic risk of having a new episode of VTE (Table).</p>

<p></p>

<p>The most important factors that influence the risk of recurrence after stopping anticoagulant therapy are the presence of a reversible provoking risk factor, unprovoked (idiopathic) VTE and the presence of active cancer.</p>

<p>Among patients with VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, the risk of recurrence is much lower if the provoking factor was recent surgery compared with a nonsurgical trigger (e.g. estrogen therapy, pregnancy, long-haul flight).</p>

<p><b>Risk factors for increased bleeding</b></p>

<p>The risk factors for increased bleeding in patients on anticoagulation are listed below (Table)</p>

<p><b>Completion of anticoagulation</b></p>

<p>There is no strong evidence to recommend routine D-dimer testing or US examination upon completion of anticoagulation in order to determine VTE recurrence and the decision to prolong therapy, unless guided by clinical symptoms. A high D-dimer does not typically predict recurrence while a normal D-dimer does not exclude recurrence. Ultrasound examination is operator-dependent and an old thrombus with partial recanalization may falsely suggest a recurrrence.</p>
