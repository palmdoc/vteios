<br/><br/><b>Algorithm</b><br/>If the score suggests likely PE, cover patient with LMWH and perform computerized tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) on the same day or within next 24 hours. If CTPA is normal, proceed with bilateral compression US scan (CUS). If these are negative, patient can be discharged to the health clinic.Computerized tomography pulmonary angiogram is now the radiological investigation of choice for PE and has superseded the ventilation-perfusion scan. Ventilation-perfusion scan is limited to very few centres in Malaysia and is not readily available. However V/Q scan still has a role in certain situations such as allergy to ionized contrast and if peripheral PE is suspected.
